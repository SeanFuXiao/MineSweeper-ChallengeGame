## Game Description

***Mine Sweeper*** is a classic puzzle game with a pirate-themed twist! Your mission is to navigate a treacherous grid filled with hidden mines. Flag all the mines to win the game, but beware‚Äîone wrong move, and you might find yourself at the bottom of the sea! I chose this theme to bring a fun and adventurous vibe to the traditional Mine Sweeper game, adding a bit of excitement with a pirate ship battle aesthetic.
